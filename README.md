# EnumerableMethods
Ruby - Creation of enumerable methods

# Enumerable Methods

For this project, we have produced our own versions of a number of common methods in Ruby's Enumerable module: 

- #my_each - a method which behaves like #each. This method was then used within the other methods we created.
- #my_each_with_index - a method which behaves like #each_with_index
- #my_select - a method which behaves like #select.
- #my_all? - a method which behaves like #all?.
- #my_any? - a method which behaves like #any?.
- #my_none? - a method which behaves like #none?.
- #my_count - a method which behaves like #count.
- #my_map - a method which behaves like #map. This method was also modified to accept either a proc or a block.
- #my_inject - which behaves like #inject.
- #multiply_els - which uses #my_inject to multiply elements accumulatively.

Every method has been tested on hashes, arrays and ranges to mirror the behaviour of the methods they were modelled from.
