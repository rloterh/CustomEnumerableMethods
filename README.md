# Custom Enumerable Methods (Microverse Ruby Module)

![Microverse](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Microverse-007bff?style=for-the-badge)


## Description 
Custom enumerable methods are created:
- #my_each - a method which behaves like #each. This method was then used within the other methods we created.
- #my_each_with_index - a method which behaves like #each_with_index
- #my_select - a method which behaves like #select.
- #my_all? - a method which behaves like #all?.
- #my_any? - a method which behaves like #any?.
- #my_none? - a method which behaves like #none?.
- #my_count - a method which behaves like #count.
- #my_map - a method which behaves like #map. This method was also modified to accept either a proc or a block.
- #my_inject - which behaves like #inject.
- #multiply_els - which uses #my_inject to multiply elements accumulatively.

Every method has been tested on hashes, arrays and ranges to mirror the behaviour of the methods they were modelled from.
The specification for this project is a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
